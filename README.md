# My Knowledge Library
 Here is a library of various knowledge that I have acquired and will acquire in the future on different aspects of programming.


From original code to compilation of other authors I will try to make a comprehensive guide, for future reference or simply to learn about different topics in the world of programming.

I hope that this guide is also useful for other people who want to learn. I am always open to any feedback to improve. 

I hope you have a nice day.
